# Page not Found

In this project we are making an assigment for the Make It Real Bootcamp. It is the page that is displayed when a user tries to access a resource that does not exist or is not available. Instead of simply displaying a generic error message, this customized page provides a friendlier and more helpful experience for users.

## Features

Custom Design: The custom deisgn was given in the task.
Explanatory Text: A clear and concise message is displayed indicating that the requested resource was not found on the server. The text was also given by the teacher.
Link to Home Page: A direct link is included to redirect the user to the website's home page, but it is just an example because it is not functional.
Responsive: The Not Found page automatically adapts to different screen sizes, and I tried to mock the design that was given.

## Instalation

No specific installation is required for the Not Found page.
